# CList - Ultimate Customizable Player List Plugin

CList is a powerful and fully configurable player list plugin for SpigotMC servers running Minecraft 1.21+. It transforms your default player list into a dynamic, organized, and visually stunning display, all controlled via a simple configuration file.

## Features

- **Fully Customizable Layout:**  
  - Configure every aspect of the player list directly in the `config.yml`.
  - Define a custom header and group lines with dynamic placeholders like `{online}` and `(groupcount)` that update in real time.

- **Permission-Based Grouping:**  
  - Assign players to groups based on permissions (e.g., `clist.group.admin`).
  - Set priorities and maximum display limits for each group. Set a limit to `-1` for unlimited display.

- **Advanced Color Support:**  
  - Supports both legacy color codes (`&c`) and hex color codes (e.g., `#FF00FF`) for a fully themed look.

- **Dynamic Configuration Reloading:**  
  - Instantly apply configuration changes with the `/clist reload` commandâ€”no server restart required.

- **Easy Integration:**  
  - Works seamlessly with your existing permission system and can be set up in minutes.
